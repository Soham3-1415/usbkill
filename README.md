usbkill

This is based on the project by hephaest0s.
It can be found at: https://github.com/hephaest0s/usbkill.

This is a shell script version that does NOT need root priveleges.
It does not have as many features as hephaest0s's version, but it can be modified quite easily.
Feel free to make additions to it as you wish and be sure to publish them if you think the community will benefit from them.

For those that are not familiar with usbkill:
It's a program that runs commands when an untrusted USB device is inserted into the computer.
It also can run commands when a USB device is removed from the computer.
It's an anti-forensic tool that was created after the arrest of Ross Ulbricht. His laptop was compromised by a foreign USB device (by the FBI) when it was in an unencrypted state.
The main command that is run is the shutdown command, so that full disk encryption can protect your files.
